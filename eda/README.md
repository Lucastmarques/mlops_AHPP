# Instructions

This module is responsible to realize an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the raw_data.csv artifact from Weights and Biases projects.

Don't forget that it will open the EDA.ipynb file in jupyterlab, so pay attetion to your browser.

To achive our goal, we use the ProfileReport package, which gives us a very good report on our dataset. We also did some manual analysis, just to be sure what we had to do in the pre-processing step.

## Run Steps

Here is an example to run this step.

```bash
mlflow run .
```
